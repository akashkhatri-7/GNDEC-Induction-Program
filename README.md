# Day 1 (31/07/2025)

**The day began at 8:30 AM with a peaceful visit to the Gurdwara Sahib on campus.** It was a spiritual start that brought calm and clarity to kick off this new chapter.

By 9:40 AM, we were served refreshments — chai, pakoras, gulab jamun — a warm welcome that gave us time to connect with our fellow freshers.

At 10:30 AM, we entered the auditorium for the formal induction session.  
The stage was vibrant, and the lineup of speakers made a big impression:

- **Mr. Harsimran Singh Jaggi** introduced us to GNDEC’s legacy, mission, and facilities.
- **Alumni speakers** Sangam Arora (CSE) and Arshpreet Singh (IT) shared real-world inspiration and career advice.

# Day 2 – (01/08/2025)

**The day kicked off at 9:30 AM with two seniors from the 3rd year conducting our English Proficiency Test.**  
It lasted around 50 minutes and tested our grasp of basic grammar, comprehension, and vocabulary.

Right after that, at **10:30 AM**, we had the **Maths Proficiency Test** — and to be honest, it felt a bit tougher than the English one. Definitely a wake-up call to brush up on fundamentals!

After a short break, we gathered again at **1:00 PM in the auditorium** for a lecture by **Dr. Arashdeep Singh** on:  
**"Food: A Pivotal Role in Student's Overall Wellness."**  
The session was insightful — covering how diet affects our focus, mood, energy, and long-term health. It was a great reminder that wellness isn’t just mental or academic, but also physical.

At **2:00 PM**, we had our final session of the day:  
**"Induction Activity Launch by the Causmic Club."**  
The club introduced itself, shared upcoming plans, and officially launched the activity phase of our induction program. It was great to see how much student-driven energy exists on campus.

###  Before 9:00 AM – Auditorium Assembly  
We reported to the **auditorium before 9:00 AM**, where we received initial instructions and a warm welcome from our **HOD**. It set the tone for a day full of insight and interaction.

###  09:00 AM – 11:00 AM  
###  Session by Dr. Jaswinder Singh — Science, Spirituality & Smiles  

This was honestly one of the most **interesting and memorable sessions** of the induction so far.

- **Dr. Jaswinder Singh** delivered a powerful lecture that blended **science, mathematics, spirituality, and humor** in a way we’d never seen before.
- He talked about the deep meaning of "**Ek Onkar**" and its connection to **108 Bhaktis** — explaining that **1 = God, 0 = Us (Ego), 8 = Wealth**. That symbolism hit deep.
- He performed live **science experiments** with **sound and light**, using them to explain meditation:  
  > *“Close your eyes — and truly see. Close your ears — and truly listen.”*  
- He even has a **portable science lab in his car**, which was honestly mind-blowing.
- What I loved the most: **it never felt like a lecture** — it felt like he came to *talk to us*, not *teach us*. And that made all the difference.

###  11:00 AM – 01:00 PM  
###  Human Values Session with Dr. Priya Darshani  

After the science session, **Dr. Priya Darshani ma'am** took over with a session on **Universal Human Values**.

- She made the environment truly **interactive and open** — frequently asking for our opinions instead of expecting “yes ma’am” answers.
- We discussed:
  - The **importance of sharing your thoughts confidently**
  - How to **introduce yourself effectively**
  - Small but powerful ways to build **self-motivation**
- She encouraged us to think for ourselves and not just agree passively — that level of respect made the session feel like a two-way conversation.
