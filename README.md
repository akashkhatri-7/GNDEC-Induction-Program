# INDUCTION DIARY

# Day 1 (31/07/2025)

**The day began at 8:30 AM with a peaceful visit to the Gurdwara Sahib on campus.** It was a spiritual start that brought calm and clarity to kick off this new chapter.

By 9:40 AM, we were served refreshments — chai, pakoras, gulab jamun — a warm welcome that gave us time to connect with our fellow freshers.

At 10:30 AM, we entered the auditorium for the formal induction session.  
The stage was vibrant, and the lineup of speakers made a big impression:

- **Mr. Harsimran Singh Jaggi** introduced us to GNDEC’s legacy, mission, and facilities.
- **Alumni speakers** Sangam Arora (CSE) and Arshpreet Singh (IT) shared real-world inspiration and career advice.
- **Mrs. Harpreet Kaur Garewal (HOD, Applied Sciences)** emphasized the importance of a strong academic foundation.
- **Dr. Akshay Girdhar (Dean Academics)** talked about balancing studies with co-curriculars.
- **Ms. Harleen Kaur**, a fellow fresher, gave a heartfelt message of encouragement.
- **Dr. Parminder Singh (Dean Student Welfare)** motivated us to engage beyond academics.
- **Dr. Sehajpal Singh (Principal)** spoke about AI, competition in tech, and the need to build our value.

**Special guests included:**
- **Shri Ravindra Garg** (Chief Engineer, Municipal Corp.) — “Stay focused. Avoid distractions. Stay grounded.”
- **Er. Rakesh Kumar** (1991 GNDEC alumnus, ADC Ludhiana) — A living example of where this journey can lead.
- **Shri Ashok Singla** — Practical tips on managing finances and loans during college life

# Day 2 – (01/08/2025)

**The day kicked off at 9:30 AM with two seniors from the 3rd year conducting our English Proficiency Test.**  
It lasted around 50 minutes and tested our grasp of basic grammar, comprehension, and vocabulary.

Right after that, at **10:30 AM**, we had the **Maths Proficiency Test** — and to be honest, it felt a bit tougher than the English one. Definitely a wake-up call to brush up on fundamentals!

After a short break, we gathered again at **1:00 PM in the auditorium** for a lecture by **Dr. Arashdeep Singh** on:  
**"Food: A Pivotal Role in Student's Overall Wellness."**  
The session was insightful — covering how diet affects our focus, mood, energy, and long-term health. It was a great reminder that wellness isn’t just mental or academic, but also physical.

At **2:00 PM**, we had our final session of the day:  
**"Induction Activity Launch by the Causmic Club."**  
The club introduced itself, shared upcoming plans, and officially launched the activity phase of our induction program. It was great to see how much student-driven energy exists on campus.
