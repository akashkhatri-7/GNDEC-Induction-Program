# INDUCTION DIARY

# Day 1 (31/07/2025)

**The day began at 8:30 AM with a peaceful visit to the Gurdwara Sahib on campus.** It was a spiritual start that brought calm and clarity to kick off this new chapter.

By 9:40 AM, we were served refreshments — chai, pakoras, gulab jamun — a warm welcome that gave us time to connect with our fellow freshers.

At 10:30 AM, we entered the auditorium for the formal induction session.
