# Day 1 (30/07/2025)

Welcome to my induction journey at GNDEC Ludhiana! Here’s a breakdown of how Day 1 unfolded, moment by moment.

---

## 08:00 – 08:20 AM  Breakfast Break  
The day began with a delicious start—steaming aloo paronthe straight from the mess kitchen. Crispy on the outside, buttery inside, and packed with spicy aloo, they were just what we needed to shake off the morning sleepiness.

## 08:30 – 09:30 AM  Visit to Gurudwara Sahib  
We eased into the day with a peaceful visit to the campus Gurudwara Sahib. Walking there as a batch, the serene sound of shabad kirtan playing in the background made everything feel grounded and reflective before diving into the induction sessions.

## 09:30 – 10:30 AM  Snack Break  
Back on campus, we enjoyed a proper Punjabi-style snack break—pakoras, hot chai, gulab jamuns, and some cold drinks served in the courtyard. A great way to recharge before the next round of activities.

---

## 10:30 – 12:30 PM  Auditorium Session  
We all gathered in the main auditorium for our formal welcome. The faculty walked us through the institute’s roots, its vision, and a tour of the impressive facilities. Seeing the investment in student clubs and labs really pumped me up for what’s ahead.

## 12:30 – 01:30 PM  Lunch in the Mess  
Lunch was comfort food done right—dal, chicken curry, steamed rice, and fresh salad. I ended up chatting with a few seniors who shared some golden tips on juggling academics and campus life.

---

## 01:30 – 03:00 PM  Department Intro (CSE)  
We split into our respective branches, and I was assigned to CSE in room G-14.

1. The CSE coordinator gave us a warm welcome and introduced our core programming courses in C++ and Python.  
2. The HOD shared a bigger picture of the department, covering labs, projects, and collaborations with industry.  
3. Two professors gave presentations on the coding and robotics clubs—definitely something I want to explore further.

## 03:00 – 07:00 PM  Free Time & Explorations  
With the sessions wrapped up, a bunch of us took to the campus on foot—exploring the library, sports complex, and of course, the cafeteria. It was the perfect chance to unwind and get to know people better.

---

## 07:00 – 08:20 PM  Hostel Club & Dinner  
Later, we hung out in the hostel’s common room and played a few rounds of table tennis (I lost, but had a blast!). Dinner followed—roti, paneer bhurji, and a side of curd. Simple, satisfying, and just what I needed.

---

## 08:20 – 11:00 PM  Late-Night Chats & Lights Out  
The day wrapped up with everyone back in their rooms, relaxing and sharing stories until lights-out. Can’t wait to see what Day 2 brings!
